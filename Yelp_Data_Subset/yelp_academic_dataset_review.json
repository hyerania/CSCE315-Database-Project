I've been there twice hoping that a re-return would change my original opinion.  The first time I was there was on a Saturday, early afternoon in Spring.

I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture, mostly living room sets and home decor.  Prices were on the high end for, let's face it folks, used furniture. The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch. So I went back again last week.  Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing).  Yep.  I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me.  \n\nIt's just an unwelcoming place.  So much potential, but the attitude there is less than acceptable.

My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate, but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop. My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new, as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made. Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA. And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now, because they barely last 1 move. \n\nEverything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods. We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift, and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off. We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed, but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient.\n\nThe same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way, which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store. I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are, but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid). I was very struck by how open and helpful the employee was. Great experience. Great selection. Great prices.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. \n\nI was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say \"If you're going to start a sale, finish it!\" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. \n\nAs I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, \"Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!\" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said \"Bitch!\" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. \n\nIt is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. \n\nToday was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Cynthia actually asked me if I wanted to take some time to consider my purchase (not pushy at all!) and I told her I loved everything and I wanted to take delivery as soon as possible.\n\nI then asked Cynthia to help me find a pair of lamps for the bed side tables I purchased. This time around I wasn't really loving anything but she took the time again to show me around and listen to my input. \n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that their pieces are pricy and that could not be further from the truth.

The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game. \n\nWe were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.\n\nThe dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.\n\nWe ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.\n\nThe pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.\n\nWe enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito.

We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes.

I have brought in a few clients with me and they never disappointed with the food. Always consistent. \n\nIf you are in the area.. Give them a try!!!!

The floor plan doesn't make any sense, and the place is really old.\n\nThe biggest issue that I had here was the staff.  They were rude and complete ignorant.  The woman that showed us around (more like pointed and told us to have a look while her lazy self watched us show our selves around) looked like she had just gotten out of bed and slipped on some flip flops.  The other guy that completely ignored us while we stood at the front entrance waiting to be helped while the other woman was in the middle of a meeting with some potential renters was in a pair of ripped jeans, an abercrombie shirt and flip flops!  COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL.\n\nOne of the things that suprised me the most was the fact that the woman that showed us around brought her phone with her and started texting while \"showing\" us around.  It was only like a 10 minute walk, I think the texting could wait.\n\nHappy to say, I won't be going back there ever again.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Additionally, the front office manager never returns phone calls and is completely unresponsive to requests.  If you rent here and don't use the front office as the property management it may be a better experience, but I would strongly recommend that no one rent here if the front office acts as the property management.   When my toilet wasn't working, I notified the front office on a Thursday and was told they couldn't have anyone out until the following Tuesday! Completely unacceptable.

Many people bought condos here when the market dipped and some only paid around 50-70K.  That should tell you what kind of people live here.  A lot of these condos are rented out and the owners do not have any kind of criteria they have to abide by.

I was first introduced to this place 4 years ago, for my friend's 18th birthday. We had an unbelievably fun time with the tempenyaki grills and a wonderful chef\/performer. \n\nI came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.\n\nI've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.\n\nIt's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward! \n\nI'm sure there are better tempenyaki places in Montreal, but Toyo will make do.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

My brother, being a local, recommended Toyo. Although you can get sushi here, the main attraction is the Teppanyaki.\n\nAs other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show\/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.\n\nOur chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).\n\nHalf way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).\n\nWe really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice. \n\nConsidering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).  \n\nIn terms of the \"show\" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive. \n\nThis place is our go-to when we want a filling, casual and awesome meal.
